// // Exercise #1:

// Recreate the guess a number game between 1 and 100. That is, the computer chooses a random number between 1 and 100, and tells the user to pick higher or lower. The user has 10 tries. Use the prompt box to help you with this.

// For example:
// var guess = prompt("Guess a number");


// // Exercise #2:

// Do the NASA countdown through the console. That is, the console should say:

// 10
// 9
// 8
// 7
// 6
// 5
// 4
// 3
// 2
// 1
// BLASTOFF!

// Hint: Use a for loop!

// Exercise #3:

var numbers = [5, 23, 98, 234, 1, 0, 3, 177];

// Write some code that prints all the numbers in the 'numbers' array to the console.
// Hint: Use a for loop!

// Exercise #4:

// Write some code that finds the average of all the numbers in the 'numbers' array.
// Hint: Use a for loop!

// Exercise #5:

// Create a function that accepts an array as an argument and returns the average. (Basically the same as Exercise #3, but wrap that code in a function and demonstrate its usage.)

// Exercise #6:

// Create an object that represents a particular book.

// Exercise #7:

// Create a constructor that allows you to create many different book objects.
